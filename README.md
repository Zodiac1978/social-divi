# Social Divi

This plugin was made to easily add more social icons to your Wordpress websites using the [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/).

## Installation

To install this plugin, just upload this folder into the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your website.

After adding the plugin to your website you can activate the plugin.


## Usage

After activating the plugin, you will see a 'Social Icons' tab in the 'Theme options' of Divi.
You will be enable icons like you would normally do with the default icons (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, RSS)

__*Please note:*__ since plugins can not override theme templates, the icons get added to the existing icons in Divi. To prevent confusion, disabled all icons in the 'General' tab.
If you are able to add or change an existing child theme, simply empty out the `includes/social_icons.php` file in your child theme to prevent this altogether.
